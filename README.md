### Insights:
- James Smith leads by a wide margin, generating over $200K, more than double several teammates.
- Some sales reps show strong outreach but lower revenue per call and conversion rates.
- New York delivers the strongest revenue per lead. This suggests higher buying intent or better positioning in that market, making it a candidate for increased investment and scalable best practices.
- More calls do not always mean more revenue. Some reps may benefit from conversion coaching.
- Lead value differs by city. Expanding effort in high-return markets can increase revenue efficiency.
